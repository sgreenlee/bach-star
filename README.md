## How to play

The gameplay of Harpsichord Hero will be very intuitive to anyone familiar with the Guitar Hero or Rock Band franchise. Notes appear on the screen and fall towards the player. For each note the player must hit the correct key at the right time. Missed notes will cause the player's star meter to deplete. The game is over when either the song ends or the star meter gets too low.

## Techs/Languages/Plugins/APIs used

Harpsichord Hero is mostly implemented in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS3. It also uses jQuery for some of the DOM manipulation.
